# toolkit-theme-2



This project just stared and is incubating.

It is build on and inspired by the [minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) great Jekyll theme and shall provided a unique layout for all Streams toolkit documentation.
Idea is that each toolkit uses this theme on it's gh-pages branch and just adds it's documentation as markdown documents. 
At the end each toolkit will have one place collecting all information on just this one site. Actually there are many places where one can find toolkit specific information. But also if there is information regarding toolkit usage available there is nearly no information regarding development and testing of a toolkit.
This theme shall enable and encourage everyone who is involved in developing and testing toolkits to document as much as possible.

New pages can be created just within the github web by writing markdown files. Navigation topics are just added with two lines in the navigation.yml file.

Lookt here to see it in action [toolkit-theme-2](https://rnostream.github.io/toolkit-theme-2/). This site runs just from this master branch as github-page.
Pull this master to your gh-pages branch and change/add your files in /_docs and your navigation in /_data/navigation.yml.
