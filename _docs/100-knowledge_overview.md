## Purpose of this toolkit

The streamsx.kafka toolkit provides those operators that help you integrate IBM Streams with Apache Kafka.
This toolkit lets you read messages from Kafka topics and write messages into topics.

This toolkit is aimed to be the predecessor of the Kafka operators of the messaging toolkit, from which the Kafka
operators may be removed some time.

## Introduction into Apache Kafka

A first place to get introduced with Kafka is the [Apache Kafka home page](https://kafka.apache.org/intro).

## Introduction into this toolkit

A good introduction into this toolkit gives this [IBM Developer Works Article](https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/docs/introducing-kafka-toolkit).
